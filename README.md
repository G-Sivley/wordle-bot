# Wordle Bot

## Description

This is an open source project with the goal of creating a bot that can solve [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) puzzle in 
the most efficient way possible.

We will be using python and list of Wordle words to narrow down the possible answers after inputting each word into Wordle.

Currently, this project will use the command line to select possible answers, but it would be interesting to implement Selenium in the future 
to actually play the game.

This is a fun project and I am very open to contributions from newer programmers. Ultimately, I would like to develop community 
with other programmers and see what we can build.

## Getting Started

To come soon...
